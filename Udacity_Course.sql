/*
Basic SQL Notes:
SELECT indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.
FROM specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table. 
LIMIT command is always the very last part of a query, use when only want to see first couple of rows of dataset.
